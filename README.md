# Garrett Gassensmith

I'm learning to become a computer wizard (Full Stack Web Developer) in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars, Node, CampusPress and many other web technologies. I take freelance development work by request and I'm looking to launch a full-time career in development!
