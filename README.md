# Garrett Gassensmith

I'm a professional cinematographer and editor living in Chicago, IL. I currently work at Northwestern University as a Digital Media Specialist and do freelance work by request. I'm also learning to become a computer wizard in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp, developing full-stack web apps from start to finish!
